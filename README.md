# OCR Weighing Ticket Parser (Java)

Parses OCR text (or sample JSON containing OCR text) into normalized fields:
- weighingDate
- vehicleNumber
- grossWeightKg
- tareWeightKg
- netWeightKg

## 🔧 Requirements
- Java 17+
- Gradle Wrapper included

## 🖥️ Tested Environment
- OS: macOS (primary)
- IDE: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
- Java: 17 (Temurin)
- Build Tool: Gradle (Wrapper)

> The project is IDE-agnostic and can be executed via Gradle Wrapper on macOS or Windows.

## 🧾 Sample Data

`samples/*.json` files are simplified examples derived from OCR provider outputs.

- Only text is used; other OCR metadata is ignored.

- Assumes raw OCR text is sufficient for this task.

## 📁 Working Directory & Path Resolution

Relative input/output paths are resolved from the project root.

The Gradle run task explicitly sets: workingDir = rootProject.projectDir

## ▶️ How to Run

### Input
#### Sample: Noisy OCR Input

The following sample demonstrates how the parser handles realistic OCR noise,
including timestamps mixed with weights, inconsistent spacing, and numeric commas.

Input (raw OCR text excerpt)
```text
 계 량 증 명 서
계량일자: 2026-02-02 0016
차량번호: 8713
거 래 처: 곰욕환경폐기물

품종명랑 05:26:18 12,480 kg
명:
중 량:
05:36:01 7,470 kg
실 중 량: 5,010 kg

* 위와 같이 계량하였음을 확인함.
동우바이오(주)
2026-02-02 05:37:55
```

#### Why this is challenging

- Time tokens (e.g., 05:26:18, 05:36:01) appear immediately before weight values
and must be removed without discarding the actual numeric weights.

- Thousand separators and spacing (12,480 kg, 7,470 kg) are inconsistently formatted
and require normalization before numeric parsing.

- Labels and values are separated across lines, making simple line-based parsing unreliable.

- This example highlights why the parser prioritizes label-based extraction, normalization, and consistency checks rather than naive pattern matching.

#### JSON (sample) or plain text
Linux / macOS:

```bash
./gradlew :app:run --args="samples/sample_01.json ./out.json"
```
Windows:

``` bat
gradlew.bat :app:run --args="samples/sample_01.json out.json"
```
> The output path (second argument) can be absolute or relative.
> Relative paths are resolved from the project root.

### Output
Example output JSON:

```json
{
  "weighingDate": "2026-02-02 05:37:55",
  "vehicleNumber": "80구8713",
  "grossWeightKg": 12480,
  "tareWeightKg": 7470,
  "netWeightKg": 5010
} 
```

#### Output Schema

The parser always produces a JSON file with the following schema:

| Field | Type | Nullable | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| weighingDate | String | Yes | Format: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` |
| vehicleNumber | String | Yes | License plate text as extracted |
| grossWeightKg | Integer | Yes | Unit: kilograms (kg) |
| tareWeightKg | Integer | Yes | Unit: kilograms (kg) |
| netWeightKg | Integer | Yes | Unit: kilograms (kg) |

In a valid weighing ticket, weight fields are
*expected* to be present, but may be `null`
when reliable extraction is not possible.

#### Weight Consistency Policy

If grossWeightKg and tareWeightKg are present,
netWeightKg may be derived as gross - tare when missing.

If extracted values violate basic consistency
(e.g. gross ≤ tare),
the affected fields are left as null
rather than force-corrected.

## Error Handling & Exit Codes

| Situation | Behavior | Exit Code |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Missing arguments | Prints usage message | 1 |
| Input file not found | Prints error to stderr | 1 |
| Parsing failure / malformed OCR | Writes JSON with `null` fields | 0 |

This ensures the tool is safe to batch-run
without unexpected crashes.

## 🧪 Tests

- Unit tests are designed to validate:

    - standard weighing tickets

    - missing or shuffled labels

    - noisy OCR output (spacing, commas, timestamps)

    - vehicle number and date extraction

- Tests can be executed with:

Run tests: 
```bash
	./gradlew test 
```

## 📜 Logging

Basic process-level logs are printed to standard output to indicate
execution flow, parsing progress, and output generation.

### Logging Example
```text
[START] OCR Weighing Ticket Parser
[INPUT]  file = samples/sample_01.json
[OUTPUT] file = ./out.json
[INFO]   OCR text extracted (length=283)
[INFO]   Weights resolved using label-based strategy
Saved: ./out.json
```

## Implementation Notes
- Extracts weighing date and vehicle number from raw text first (to avoid losing time tokens during normalization).

- Normalizes text:

    - removes time tokens (e.g., 05:36, 05:36:01)
    - normalizes unit variants to kg
    - removes numeric commas (e.g., 14,080 → 14080)
    - collapses repeated whitespace

- Weight extraction strategy:

    - prioritizes label-based parsing (총중량/차중량/실중량) 
    - falls back to heuristic extraction when labels are missing
    - derives missing values using net = gross - tare when possible

- Fault-tolerant:

    - never crashes on malformed input
    - always produces an output JSON
 
### Parsing & Resolution Policy

**Priority order**
1. Label-based extraction (총중량 / 차중량 / 실중량)
2. Heuristic numeric extraction (pattern-based kg detection)
3. Arithmetic derivation (`net = gross - tare`, when safe)

**Conflict resolution**
- Explicitly labeled values take precedence over heuristics.
- When multiple numeric candidates exist, the most plausible
  combination satisfying `gross > tare` and
  `net = gross - tare` is selected.
- Ambiguous or contradictory data is not guessed.

**Null tolerance**
- The parsing stage prioritizes maximum data recovery.
- Missing or uncertain fields may remain `null`.
- Semantic validation is deferred to a later stage
  (verification or persistence).

## ⚠️ Limitations
- License plate patterns are simplified and may not cover all regional formats.

- Date parsing currently supports common numeric formats only (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss).

- The parser relies on rule-based heuristics and regular expressions;
no machine learning–based entity recognition is used.

- Severe OCR corruption may still result in missing (null) fields.
- - The weighing date is extracted only when an explicit `계량일자` label is present.
  Generic labels such as `날짜` are excluded to avoid misinterpreting non-weighing dates.

## 🧠 Design Rationale

Parsing and validation are intentionally separated.

- The parsing stage focuses on maximum data recovery and allows null values.

- Semantic validation (NOT NULL, consistency checks) is expected to be applied
during a later verification or persistence stage.

This approach prevents silent data corruption while maintaining robustness
against OCR failures.

### Weight Parsing Notes

Weights are parsed as integer kilograms.
Both large values (e.g. 12,480 kg) and small values below 1,000 kg
(e.g. 480 kg) are supported, as OCR output may omit thousand separators
or split digits inconsistently.


## Assumptions
- All weight values are expressed in kilograms (kg).

- A valid weighing ticket follows the relationship:

    - grossWeightKg > tareWeightKg

    - netWeightKg = grossWeightKg - tareWeightKg

- OCR text may contain timestamps, line breaks, duplicated tokens, or corrupted spacing.

- Vehicle number and weighing date are typically present near the header area of the ticket.


## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Introduce a state-based pipeline:

    - PARSED → VERIFIED → PERSISTED

- Enforce NOT NULL and semantic constraints at the persistence layer
(e.g., database CHECK constraints).

- Improve license plate validation using stricter domain rules.

- Support additional date formats and locale-aware parsing.

- Optionally integrate NLP-based entity recognition (e.g., spaCy) as a secondary strategy.
